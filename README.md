##Features

###Categories
**Have your entries sorted into categories as you add and edit them.**

The application has several predefined categories that your entries are sorted into.
The categories are located at the top right of the application. Clicking on one
will select the category and filter entries.

###Custom Categories

**Create your own named categories and add/remove entries to them.**

Right click on an entry, scroll down to "categories", choose whether
you want to add or remove the entry to a category and click the category
in the list. You will need to have at least one custom category for this to work.

To create a custom category: in the categories window (top right), right click
anywhere in the list box or click the green plus icon on top of the list.
A small window will appear, asking for a name for the category, give the
category a name and hit enter.

You can edit and remove the category by right clicking it or by selected it and
using the category control buttons (three buttons located on top of the categories).

- The green plus icon adds a category.
- The yellow circular arrow icon edits the selected category.
- The red cross icon removes the selected category.
